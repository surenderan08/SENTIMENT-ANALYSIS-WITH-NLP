## Project Overview
In this project, we:

- Load a dataset of customer reviews.
- Preprocess the text data by cleaning and transforming it into a numerical format using TF-IDF Vectorization.
- Train a Logistic Regression model to classify the sentiment of the reviews.
- Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Visualize the results and provide example predictions.

To run this project, you need to install the following Python libraries:

- pandas - for data manipulation.
- scikit-learn - for machine learning and model evaluation.
- nltk - for natural language processing tasks.
- matplotlib - for visualizations.
- seaborn - for advanced plotting.
