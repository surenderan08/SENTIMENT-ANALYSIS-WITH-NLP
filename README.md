# SENTIMENT-ANALYSIS-WITH-NLP_TASK 2

**COMPANY** : CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS

**NAME** : SURENDERAN R

**INTERN ID** : CT08DZZ

**DOMAIN** : MACHINE LEARNING

**BATCH DURATION** : DECEMBER 17th,2024 to JANUARY 17th,2025

## Project Overview
In this project, we:

- Load a dataset of customer reviews.
- Preprocess the text data by cleaning and transforming it into a numerical format using TF-IDF Vectorization.
- Train a Logistic Regression model to classify the sentiment of the reviews.
- Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Visualize the results and provide example predictions.

## Requirements
To run this project, you need to install the following Python libraries:

- pandas - for data manipulation.
- scikit-learn - for machine learning and model evaluation.
- nltk - for natural language processing tasks.
- matplotlib - for visualizations.
- seaborn - for advanced plotting.

## Dataset
The dataset contains customer reviews with corresponding sentiment labels (positive or negative). The dataset should have a column for the text of the review and a column for the sentiment label.
For demonstration purposes, you can use the Sentiment140 dataset or any other dataset with customer reviews and sentiment labels. If you have your own dataset, simply replace it in the code with pd.read_csv().

## Code Structure
- sentiment_analysis.ipynb: The main Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation.
- requirements.txt: Lists the Python dependencies required to run the project.

## Conclusion
This project showcases how to build a Sentiment Analysis model using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques like TF-IDF Vectorization and Logistic Regression. You can use this approach to classify sentiment on customer reviews, product feedback, or any text data that can be labeled with sentiment (positive or negative).
